## Problem 2

``` r
education_count =
  full_accel_df %>% 
  distinct(seqn, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(sex, education) %>% 
   summarize(counts = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

``` r
knitr::kable(education_count)
```

| sex | education | counts |
|:----|:----------|-------:|
| 1   | 1         |     27 |
| 1   | 2         |     34 |
| 1   | 3         |     54 |
| 2   | 1         |     28 |
| 2   | 2         |     23 |
| 2   | 3         |     59 |

``` r
demo_plot = 
  demo_df %>% 
  filter(age > 21) %>%
  na.omit(demo_df) %>% 
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female"))

new_label= c("Female", "Male")

ggplot(demo_plot, aes(x = age, fill = education)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .4, adjust = .5, color = "blue") +
  facet_grid(~sex) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Education Levels by Age",
       x = "Age", y = "density",
       fill = "Education Level") +
  scale_fill_discrete(
    labels = c("1" = "Less than High School", "2" = "High School Equivalent", "3" = "More than High School")
    )
```
